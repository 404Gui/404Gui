## ðŸ‘¾ Hey! I'm < Guilherme /> and I build stuff

Iâ€™m a full-stack developer who enjoys building things and creating practical solutions. I currently work mostly with JavaScript, TypeScript, React, .NET, SQL, and Python, but I enjoy exploring and learning other tools and stacks to apply in my projects. Here, youâ€™ll find projects that blend curiosity, learning, and a personal touch
